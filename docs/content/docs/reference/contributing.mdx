## Ways to Contribute

### Issues and Bug Fixes

- Check our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/issues) for tasks labeled `good first issue`
- When reporting bugs, include steps to reproduce and expected behavior
- Comment on issues you'd like to work on to avoid duplicate efforts

### Framework Integrations

We welcome contributions to support more frameworks:

- Focus on framework-agnostic solutions where possible
- Keep integrations minimal and maintainable
- All integrations currently live in the main package

### Plugin Development

- For core plugins: Open an issue first to discuss your idea
- For community plugins: Feel free to develop independently
- Follow our plugin architecture guidelines

### Documentation

- Fix typos and errors
- Add examples and clarify existing content
- Ensure documentation is up-to-date with code changes

## Testing

We use Vitest for testing. Place test files next to the source files they test:

```ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { getTestInstance } from "./test-utils/test-instance";

describe("Feature", () => {
    it("should work as expected", async () => {
        const { client } = getTestInstance();
        // Test code here
        expect(result).toBeDefined();
    });
});
```

### Testing Best Practices

- Write descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Keep tests focused and atomic
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions

## Pull Request Process

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### 1. Ensure your code passes tests
        
        ```bash
        pnpm test
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### 2. Push changes and create PR
        
        ```bash
        git push origin feature/your-feature-name
        ```
        
        Create a pull request on GitHub with a clear description of your changes.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### 3. Address feedback
        
        Be responsive to code review feedback and make necessary changes.
    </Step>
</Steps>
